1. what is mongodb (latest 6.0) (used 4.5)
    - Mongodb is document oriented Nosql database with optional schemas.
    - Mongodb uses the collections, just like Mysql uses tables.
    - inside collections we have document.
    - document consist of key and values.
    - Mongodb is document oriented Nosql database use for high value of storage. whereas sql is programing language use 
	to communicate with and manipulate relation database like mysql
    Advantages:
        - Mongodb is Schema less database.
        - there may be difference between number of fields, size and content of the document.
        - it is easy to scale.
        - It uses ram to store the data. so is fast to access it.
        - it support replication. means primary server goes down then secondary server handle the request wothout human interaction.
        - support nested document so No complex join is require.
        - rich query language
        - MongoDB can be used as file storage a using GridFS.

2. datatypes
    - Number, string, date, boolean, array, embedded documents.

3. Indexing 
    - indexes are used to process queries more efficiently.
    - indexing store some information related to a documents so is is easy for mongodb to find right document
    - without indexing mongodb scan all the documents in a collection and retrive matching document.
    - db.COLLECTION_NAME.createIndex({KEY:1})
    - db.NAME_OF_COLLECTION.dropIndex({KEY:1})
    - db.NAME_OF_COLLECTION.dropIndexes({KEY1:1, KEY2: 1})
    - db.NAME_OF_COLLECTION.getIndexes()

4. set modifier 
    - if the value of the field does not exist the set is used to update the document.

5. sharding
    - sharding is the process of storing the data across multiple machines. it is done by horizontal scalling.
    - In MongoDB, sharding is achieved by splitting large data sets into small data sets across multiple MongoDB instances
    - as the size of data increases, a single machine not sufficient to store all the data and not provide accetable read and write operation.
    - Each MongoDB Database consists of a large number of Collections. Each Collection is made up of a large number of Documents that store data as Key-Value pairs.
	 MongoDB Sharding breaks up a large Collection into smaller Collections called Shards. Splitting up large Collections into
         Shards allows MongoDB to execute queries without putting much load on the Server.
    
    why sharding
        - vertical scalling is to expensive and we can increase it to certain limit.
        - Single replica set has limitation of 12 nodes and only primary nodejs has write access.

6. replication
    - replication is the method of duplication of data across multilpe servers
    - In replication each replica set contains one primary and multiple secondary nodes.
    - the primary node receives all the write operation and record all the changes in data.
    - then sec nodejs copy and apply the changes in asyncronous manner
    - if primary node get fails then any one of sec acts as primary node.

    why replication 
        - High availibility of data
        - No downtime of maintaince

7. Explain Primary and Secondary Replica Sets
    -Primary Replica Set receives all the write operations from the clients. Secondary replica sets 
    replicate the primary replica sets and implement the operations for their datasets so that secondary 
    datasets affect the primary datasets.

8. GridFS: We use GridFS to retrieve and store large files like images, videos, and audio files

9. What are the aggregate functions of MongoDB
    - AVG, Sum, Min, Max, First, Push, addToSet, Last

10. Mongodb v/s Mysql
    - Mongodb is Nosql database and store the data in BJSON document where Mysql is relational database and use tables to store the data
    - Mongodb has dynamic schema where Mysql has fix schema
    - Mongodb allows horizontal and vertical scalling where Mysql allows vertical scalling
    - Mongodb dosent support joons where Mysql supports joins.

11. Why mongodb used
    - Highly scalability (sharding)
    - High avalibility (replication)
    - schema less model
    - support nested document

12. what is moongoose
    - Mongoose is object data modelling library. it manage the relation ship between data and provide
        schema validation

    Advantages
        - easily changing schemas
        - data validation
        - self documentation
        - 


disadvantages of mongodb

can we connect mongodb without mongoose

document size 16 mb

explain storage engine



* how to create schema in mongoDb ? 
	- mongoDb is schema less database.
	- the schema of database is the describe the structure of data to be stored.
	- mongoDb facilited flaxibility into schema design there by orgenizing storage of data as key and value paire.	

* Difference betwwn mangoDb and sql ?

	- sql structure of data is represented in tabels , mongoDb structure data represented in document.
	- sql is pre define scema , whereas mongodb id dynamic schema.
	- sql is vertically scalable, where as mongodb is horizantally and vericalii scalable.
	- support automic operations for transactions , mongodb no proper support automic for transaction.
	- support join in operation where as mongodb does not support join operation.
